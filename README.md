###WORK IN PROGRESS###

Repository of my progress in the 42Adel November Piscine 2021.

The &ltproject&gt-dev folder is my working directory for my project where I build the project. If you want to follow my git commits/changes etc you can see them in this folder. This is generally the most up to date repo including any changes I have made after submission (if I decided not to resubmit it). This directory also includes files that I would like to keep but are not able to be submitted (the subject pdf's, my test files, etc).

The &ltproject&gt folder is my "submission" folder of files in the state that I am submitting them to the vogsphere. The corresponding moulinette grading/scoring is below.

<table border = "1" cellpadding = "4" cellspacing = "0">
<thead><tr>
<th align = "left">Project</th>
<th>Moulinette Grade</th>
<th>Exercise pass/fail</th>
<th>Comments</th></th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>

<tr valign = "top">
<td>C04 - Submission 1</td>
<td>70%</td>
<td>ex00: OK | ex01: OK | ex02: OK | ex03: OK | ex04: KO | ex05: OK</td>
<td>ex04: Char for 0 val was hardcoded as "0" char rather than base[0]</td>
</tr>

<tr valign = "top">
<td>C04 - Submission 2</td>
<td>100%</td>
<td>ex00: OK | ex01: OK | ex02: OK | ex03: OK | ex04: OK | ex05: OK<td>
<td></td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

I haven't gotten around to it but I'll add which exercises passed/failed at some stage (or you can come up and ask me lol)
