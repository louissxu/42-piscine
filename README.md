###WORK IN PROGRESS###

Repository of my progress in the 42Adel November Piscine 2021.

The [project]-dev folder is my working directory for my project where I build the project. If you want to follow my git commits/changes etc you can see them in this folder. This is generally the most up to date repo including any changes I have made after submission (if I decided not to resubmit it). This directory also includes files that I would like to keep but are not able to be submitted (the subject pdf's, my test files, etc).

The [project] folder is my "submission" folder of files in the state that I am submitting them to the vogsphere. The corresponding moulinette grading/scoring is below.

<table border = "1" cellpadding = "4" cellspacing = "0">

<tr valign = "top">
<td>C04 - Submission 1</td>
<td>70% (pass)</td>
<td>ex00: OK | ex01: OK | ex02: OK | ex03: OK | ex04: KO | ex05: OK</td>
<td>ex04: Char for 0 val was hardcoded as "0" char rather than base[0]</td>
</tr>

<tr valign = "top">
<td>C04 - Submission 2</td>
<td>100% (pass)</td>
<td>ex00: OK | ex01: OK | ex02: OK | ex03: OK | ex04: OK | ex05: OK</td>

<tr valign = "top">
<td>C05 - Submission 1</td>
<td>50% (pass)</td>
<td>ex00: OK | ex01: OK | ex02: OK | ex03: OK | ex04: OK | ex05: OK | ex06: KO | ex07: Timeout | ex08: OK</td>
<td>ex07: Not sure what a timeout error is. From deeptrace, all the tests pass and provide the correct solution. Maybe the solution is too inefficient and there is some upper ceiling of allowed compute time even if it passes all the tests?</td>
</tr>

<tr valign = "top">
<td>C06 - Submission 1</td>
<td>70% (pass)</td>
<td>ex00: OK | ex01: OK | ex02: OK | ex03: KO</td>
<td>ex03: ?? Not sure. Will need to do more debugging as to why this failed</td>
</tr>

I haven't gotten around to it but I'll add which exercises passed/failed at some stage (or you can come up and ask me lol)
